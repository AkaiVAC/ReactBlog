# Functional Blog using React

This project has been created as an exploration of React's various features in a practical use case. Here, we have a simple blog site built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for the front-end and [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling and as dev-server.

_Note: This readme file will continue to be updated in the future as the project grows and newer features and/or dependencies are added._
